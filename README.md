# SMD soldering challenge


This project is about hand-soldering tiny SMD components onto a PCB.
The approach became popular at [Defcon](https://dchhv.org/events/smdsolderchallenge.html) in [2018](https://hackaday.com/2018/08/02/smd-soldering-challenge-lands-at-def-con/).


My goals:
- I wanna try! (both with and without extra tools).
  In the past, I've done some PCB development, debugging, soldering and measuring around 2008 for developing digital cameras, with large FPGAs (Xilinx Vertex), my own DDR Memory controller and complex 10+ layer PCBs. Back then, this was no 0201 and I'm much older now with many years of just Matlab coding and only little electronics.
  

- I don't think that I will succeed on the first try.
  I will need more than one shot with the tiny components, especially towards 0201. 
  the kit from the set above comes with one component each - this is not enough.

- Learn some more! 
  The new Kicad 6 looks realy good and I'm lacking practice in PCB design, this looks like a good chance for a quick project with focus on aesthetics.   
  I've not worked wit Atmel microcontrollers for over 15 years - time to refresh.
  
- Maybe this is for sharing?
  In the last years I met a few electronics developers who might like to be gifted a kit. I'm certainly not going to order just one set.
  
  
  
  
Status:
- components have been ordered
- PCB has been ordered, but not arrived/tested yet. Before cloning I would suggest to wait for feedback if all went well.
